# Custom Fonts

I have strong opinions about monospaced fonts. I have a vague idea how to use fontforge. This is the result of the collision of the two... 

## License

All fonts are licensed under whatever the original license is. I generally haven't kept that info around, so just guess that it is some sort of free. 

## Font Opinion

1. Zero should be dotted
2. Three should be flat top
3. Lower case `g` should be double story
4. Lower case `a` should be double story
5. The `5` and capital `S` shouldn't look similar when blurry 
6. The `8` and capital `B` shouldn't look similar when blurry
7. Ligatures are good
