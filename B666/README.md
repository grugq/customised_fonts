# B 666

A slightly modified version of the excellent B612 mono font.

I have dotted the zero to make it stand out.

I the asterisk has been lowered to be on the x line.

the {} have been made curvier.

I have not changed the g to a double stack, which I would like.

I have not been about to makeith e() [] more distinct. There is a problem with 
the .;:; '`" groups as well. They are all too similar. But For now, this is what
the limits of my skill with FontForge enable me to do.


Also, I don't kmow anything about the license. I don't know if i can modify it 
and release with a new name, or what. So... if anyone knows wtf the deal is, help
me updated it!
