# Home Office Code Pro D

Source Code Pro -> an excellent coding font by Adobe: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro
Office Code Pro D -> a customised version of Source Code Pro: https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro
Home Office Code Pro D -> Office Code Pro D + Ligatures from: https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer

This is basically Source Code Pro with some minor changes, and then I added ligatures.
